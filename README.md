# AutoDrive
This code will "theoretically" solve any maze using sensors and different algorithms.

# auto_routine_1
This routine uses one ultrasonic sensor and one gyroscope. In "theory" the robot should constantly be moving forward until it is close to an object(a wall in the maze). If it does detect a wall, it will then rotate and move forward in a straight line with some P loop tuning utilizing the gyroscopes. The process continues to keep running until it exits the maze.

# auto_routine_2
still under construction I am currently thinking of using the mecanum wheels to straph and see how that goes(I might need more sensor for that).
