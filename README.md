This code will "theoretically" solve a maze using ultrasonics and gyroscope sensors. How it works is, it utilizes the ultrasonic to detect how close it is to a wall, and if it is, it will turn and move forward in a straight path with a simple P loop tuning. I might make updates for different approaches to solve the maze such as straphing, dynamic movement, etc.
